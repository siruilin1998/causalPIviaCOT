# Plot Instructions

To generate the plots in Figure 2,

Figure 2(a): linear location model -> well_test.py
Figure 2(b): quadratic location model -> square_test.py
Figure 2(c): scale model -> prod_test.py

Figure 2(d): linear location model -> well_prop.py
Figure 2(e): quadratic location model -> square_prop.py
Figure 2(f): scale model -> prod_prop.py

For real data experiment,
